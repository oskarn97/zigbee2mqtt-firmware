--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.6.3a
October 16, 2015


Notices:
 - Z-Stack 2.6.3 has been certified as a ZigBee Compliant Platform (ZCP) for
   the devices, and toolchain versions listed below.

 - Z-Stack for the CC2530/CC2531 platforms has been built and tested with
   IAR's CLIB library, which provides a light-weight C library which does not
   support Embedded C++. Use of DLIB is not recommended for those platforms.
   Z-Stack for CC2538 platform has been tested with the DLIB library.

 - Z-Stack projects specify compile options in two ways: (1) "-D" statements
   in f8wConfig.cfg and other *.cfg files, (2) entries in the IDE Compiler
   Preprocessor Defined Symbols. When using the EW8051 or EW430 compilers,
   settings made in the IDE will override settings in the *.cfg files. When
   using the EWARM compiler, settings in the *.cfg files will override any
   made in the IDE.

 - When programming devices for the first time with this release, the entire
   Flash memory should be erased. For the CC2530/CC2531 and EXP5438 platforms,
   select "Erase Flash" in the "Debugger->Texas Instruments->Download" tab of
   the project options. For CC2538 devices, select "Project->Download->Erase
   Memory" tab of the project options.

 - Application, library, and hex files were built/tested with the following
   versions of IAR tools and may not work with different IAR tool versions:
     - CC2538 + SRF06EB:  EWARM 7.40.2  (7.40.2.8570)
     - CC2530 + SRF05EB:  EW8051 9.10.1 (9.10.1.2146)
     - CC2530 + EXP5438:  EW430 6.20.1  (6.20.1.931)

 - Foundation software library files for the CC2538 include the following:
     - bsp.lib, version 1.3.1
     - driverlib.lib, version 1.3.1
     - usblib.lib, version 1.0.1


Changes:
 Version 2.6.3a:
 - [6975] Changed ZDP_MgmtPermitJoinReq() to also check the destination address
   mode for "AddrBroadcast" when deciding whether to "send to self".

 Version 2.6.3:
 - [6357] A new Monitor-Test command has been added to provide parameters for
   the new enhanced rejoin mechanism. See section 3.12.1.33 of the "Z-Stack
   Monitor and Test API" document for details on ZDO_SET_REJOIN_PARAMETERS.

 - [6180] Added the function ZDApp_ChangeState() to enhance processing of
   'devState' changes and setting the ZDO event to send App notifications.

 - [6122] Enhanced the leave mechanism to retain NV information when the
   leave request is with rejoin=1 and the device does not reset, allowing it
   to preserve volatile application data.

 - [6079] Improved handling of the situation where the original parent of a
   sleeping End-Device misses the Device Announcement when the child changes
   its parent. This provides faster recovery than waiting for Child Aging.

 - [6078] Implemented a Parent Announce mechanism for routers to exchange two
   new ZDO messages specified by R21 Child Management. The new "Parent_annce"
   and "Parent_annce_rsp" messages are used to determine which is the real
   parent router of specific child End-Devices.

 - [5956] Reduced memory usage in End-Device builds by removing un-necessary
   references to the Associated Device list.

 - [5476] Implemented the "enhanced" rejoin mechanism for aged out End-Devices
   as suggested by the R21 specification. An End-Device can try both Secure
   Rejoin and TC Rejoin to rejoin a network after it has been aged out and
   told to leave.

 - [5475] Implemented Orphan Scan Notification as the child aging keep-alive
   mechanism required by the R21 specification.

 - [5474] Implemented timeout establishment for the child aging mechanism in
   the R21 specification. This includes End-Devices sending the new "End
   Device Timeout Request" command once they have joined the network.

 - [5472] Updated neighbor table behavior as needed to support the child
   aging mechanism in the R21 specification.

 - [5471] Added NIB elements, stored in Z-Stack "zg" variables, as required to
   support the child aging mechanism in the R21 specification.

 - [5470] Moved EndDeviceTimeout Request and Response commands from ZDO to NWK
   layer as required in the R21 specification.

 - [5468] Removed the ZIGBEE_CHILD_AGING compile flag from Z-Stack code since
   "Child Aging and Recovery Protocol" becomes a mandatory feature in the R21
   specification.
   
 - [5467] Implemented End-Device Initiator functionality as required for the
   child aging feature in the approved R21 specification.

 - [5217] Modified the NWK message buffer system to delete queued messages for
   a non-RX_ON_IDLE device when a rejoin request is received from it. Queued
   messages are also deleted for a child (non-parent) when a leave indication
   is received for it.

 - [5168] Changed the NLME_SetPollRate() function to accept a 32-bit timer
   parameter, allowing for polling intervals longer than 65.535 seconds. The
   variable 'zgPollRate' was changed to 32-bit, along with the associated
   NV item. Added backward-compatible MT support forthe old 16-bit NV item.

 - [4583] Modified Coordinator network start-up behavior to save the selected
   PanID and other NIB information to Non-Volatile memory before any child
   device associates to it. If the Coordinator has a reset while waiting for
   other devices to join, it will retain the original PanID.


Bug Fixes:
 Version 2.6.3a:
 - [6970] Fixed a problem where a non-sleeping End-Device rejoined the network
   (via Rejoin Request) to a different parent because the old parent had left
   the network - the End-Device continued to send Device Announce to the old
   parent after the old parent had also rejoined via Rejoin Request.

 - [6967] Fixed a problem where a non-sleeping End-Device rejoined the network
   via Rejoin Request, to the same parent after the parent had left the network
   and come back via MAC Association - the End-Device would start to poll the
   parent at random intervals, observed in a range of 0.10 to 11 seconds.

 - [6957] Corrected the zcl_ProcessMessageMSG() callback to reject an incoming
   message when the minimum command data length is not met.

 - [6951] Removed a compile error in zclGeneral_ProcessInGroupsServer() that
   would occur when ZCL_SCENES was not enabled when ZCL_GROUPS was.
   
 - [6950] Fixed a problem where a router with two neighbors in the Link Status
   (one with Incoming/Outgoing cost = MAX_LINK_COST) would not send any packet
   to the neighbor that had MAX_LINK_COST status.

 - [6935] Fixed a problem in the network message buffering system where an End-
   Device, with POWER_SAVING enabled, could mistakenly enter "Deep Sleep" mode
   (no timer events scheduled) when a buffer timer just transitioned to expired.

 - [6917] Added the function APS_RemoveDupRej() to remove an entry from the APS
   duplicate message rejection table. 

 - [6916] Fixed an issue where an orphaned End-Device could accept Coordinator
   Realignment from a ZigBee Coordinator that was not its original parent and
   later would ignore the Realignment from its original parent, stopping normal
   communication with that parent. See macRadioStopScan() for change details.

 - [6902] Fixed a problem where an End-Device would fail to rejoin the network
   after missing a NWK key change. The functions ZDApp_ProcessNetworkJoin() and
   ZDO_SyncIndicationCB() were modified to improve rejoin backoff operation.

 - [6897] Corrected an issue for End-Devices where the security frame counter
   would be reset to zero each time there was a rejoin - causing the parent to
   ignore messages from the End-Device. See ZDApp_ProcessOSALMsg() for details.

 - [6887] Fixed a problem where retries of a ZCL command with APS ACK enabled
   would be sent with APS ACK disabled, resulting in a DataConfirm with the
   wrong transaction ID.

 - [6883] Modified ZDO_JoinIndicationCB() and ZDO_LeaveInd() to fix a problem
   where an always-on End-Device would leave the network when its parent was
   asked to leave without rejoin and removeChildren was set to FALSE.

 - [6842] Reverted the optimization made in [6079] - in certain circumstances,
   the End-Device could become "stranded" in the network without a parent.

 - [6771] Fixed a problem with many-to-one routing where a 'random neighbor'
   with worst possible link cost would not be selected when no other neighbor
   was available.

 - [6737] Fixed a problem, introduced with [5455], where the AF Transaction
   ID would get overwritten by an APS counter, causing the transID of the
   AF_DATA_CONFIRM to not match the one sent with AF_DATA_REQUEST.

 - [5024] Fixed a problem in ZDO_ProcessMgmtLqiReq() where the IEEE address
   would be returned as 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF WHEN the device was found in the
   neighbor table instead of the associated device table.

 Version 2.6.3:
 - [6365] Fixed a problem where an UpdateDevice message for a leaving device
   would only be sent to the Trust Center by the parent router even if other
   routers at radius=1 heard the broadcast LeaveIndication. The UpdateDevice
   message would not get delivered if the parent router was turned off.

 - [6346] Fixed a race condition that could occur when an End-device sent two
   NWK Rejoin Requests to a potential parent and didn't received the Rejoin
   Response. The End-device would stop polling and could never rejoin until
   the device was reset.

 - [6231] Changed ZDApp_NVUpdate() to set an event, instead of a timer, for
   End-Devices to save network parameters immediately to NV after it joins.

 - [6165] Changed the definition of 0xFFFE as an invalid PanID to allow it
   to be used - this would not allow TI devices to operate in a network with
   that PanID, creating a potential inter-operability problem.

 - [6153] Handled a rare situation where two parents have the same End-Device
   in their association table with different short addresses and the former
   parent sends a Coordinator Realignment with the former short address that
   is different from the current short address of the End-Device.

 - [6077] Fixed an issue where an End-Device Secure Rejoin failed because the
   Update Device message could not be sent to the Trust Center and the parent
   silently removed the End-Device from its associated device list, stopping
   it from forwarding messages to the End-Device.

 - [6070] Reduced the time for an End-Device to send orphan notification on
   higher channels - now does not default to trying all 16 channels.

 - [6043] Removed possible transmissions from a device that has been requested
   to leave but is waiting for LEAVE_RESET_DELAY to reset. This eliminates the
   "spurious" End-Device polling and Router link-status messages.

 - [5783] Fixed a problem in the CC2530 MAC where a transmit packet is would
   be "pended" during active packet reception but never got sent. Transmit
   packets would not be sent until the device received its next packet.

 - [5771] Enhanced RF error handling in the CC2538 MAC by also processing
   strobe and synth lock errors. Refer to macMcuRfErrIsr() for details.

 - [5770] Corrected RF error handling in the CC2538 MAC by also clearing the
   error flag from the NVIC register. Refer to macMcuRfErrIsr() for details.

 - [5698] Fixed a problem where a child was aged out of the child table and
   sent a leave command, it performed a MAC association. If the association
   permit was false it would not rejoin the network and find a new parent.

 - [5696] Fixed a problem on CC2538 devices where memory area for customer
   commissioning of IEEE address (CCA) would be filled with zeroes, causing
   the device to wake up with a bogus IEEE address of 0x0000000000000000 in
   the secondary location, preventing use of the primary IEEE address.

 - [5626] Fixed a problem where an RX-Always-On End-Device saw a DeviceAnnce,
   its parent could be removed from the neighbor table, resulting in sending
   NwkStatus "No Route Available" when it receives messages from its parent.

 - [5563] Improved End-Device power consumption by turning off the receiver
   sooner after receiving a MAC ACK.

 - [5455] Fixed the APS retransmission mechanism to increment the APS frame
   counter for each retry and for each APS ACK.

 - [5270] Fixed a problem with Many-To-One routing where the routing table
   entry was not properly freed even when the concentrator left the network.

 - [5067] Improved sleeping End-Device power consumption by allowing it to
   sleep while waiting for an APS ACK. Previously, it would not sleep until
   it revived the ACK or exhausted its APS retries.

 - [4966] Fixed a scenario that once a Many-To-One (MTO) route discovery was
   complete and every router had the MTO routing entry to the concentrator, a
   newly joined device that hadn't yet participated in the MTO route discovery
   was not able to send a packet to the concentrator until it got the MTO
   routing entry by next MTO route discovery request from the concentrator.

 - [4811] Fixed a problem where a child device changed its NWK address because
   itr rejoined the network via MAC association. It was no longer able to do
   secure communications because it had reset the frame counter to zero. 

 - [4579] Fixed a problem with PA/LNA devices where the control signals for
   the PA/LNA would not works correctly after the radio woke up from sleep. 

 - [4504] Fixed a problem where a device that received a Leave Request with
   Rejoin set to true, would clear its NV information, making it not capable
   of rejoining the previous network without doing MAC association.

 - [4454] Fixed a problem where an End-Device would not try to rejoin its
   parent if the parent's end-device capacity status was set to zero.

 - [4453] Fixed a problem where an End-Device would not try to rejoin its
   parent if the parent's associate permit status was set to false.

 - [4225] Fixed a Monitor-Test (MT) problem where the device did not respond
   to a SYS_OSAL_NV_READ command from Z-Tool for NV item 0x0022. MT response
   would be dropped silently if the requested data block was larger than the
   serial TX buffer. 

 - [4035] Fixed a problem where an End-Device would get confused after reset
   in the following scenario: (1) two Coordinators, A and B, have networks on
   different channels, (2) End-Device joins network A on lower channel, (3)
   Coordinator A is turned off, (4) End-Device resets, clears NV, and joins
   Coordinator B, (5) Coordinator A is turned back on, (6) reset End-device
   and observe that it sent rejoin request to Coordinator A instead of B.

 - [3366] Fixed a Monitor-Test (MT) problem where the device did not respond
   to a UTIL_ZCL_KEY_EST_SIGN command from Z-Tool.
