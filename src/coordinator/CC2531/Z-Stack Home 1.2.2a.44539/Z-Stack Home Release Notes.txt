Z-Stack Home Release Notes

Version 1.2.2a
October 16, 2015


Notices:
 - Z-Stack Home 1.2.2a meets requirements for full conformance to the ZigBee
   Home Automation 1.2 specification. The Z-Stack Home 1.2.2a release is based
   on Z-Stack Core 2.6.3a - see the "Z-Stack Core Release Notes" for details.

 - Z-Stack Home provides over 20 documents that cover various aspects of this
   Home Automation development package. Included is API documentation for each
   layer of the Z-Stack system, and a selection of Developer's Guides, User's
   Guides, and Application Notes to accelerate your product development. These
   documents can be found at: <InstallPath>\Documents folder with the default
   set to: "C:\Texas Instruments\Z-Stack Home 1.2.2.44539\Documents" which can
   be accessed from the Windows Start Menu.

 - Z-Stack for the CC2530 platform has been built and tested with IAR's CLIB
   library, which provides a light-weight C library which does not support
   Embedded C++. Use of DLIB is not recommended for this platform. Z-Stack
   for the CC2538 platform has been tested with the DLIB library.

 - Z-Stack projects specify compile options in two ways: (1) "-D" statements
   in f8wConfig.cfg and other *.cfg files, (2) entries in the IDE Compiler
   Preprocessor Defined Symbols. When using the EW8051 or EW430 compilers,
   settings made in the IDE will override settings in the *.cfg files. When
   using the EWARM compiler, settings in the *.cfg files will override any
   made in the IDE.

 - When programming devices for the first time with this release, the entire
   Flash memory should be erased. For the CC2530 and EXP5438 platforms, select
   "Erase Flash" in the "Debugger->Texas Instruments->Download" tab of the
   project options. For the CC2538, select "Project->Download->Erase Memory".

 - Application, library, and hex files were built/tested with the following
   versions of IAR tools and may not work with different IAR tool versions:
     - CC2538 + SRF06EB:  EWARM 7.40.2  (7.40.2.8570)
     - CC2530 + SRF05EB:  EW8051 9.10.1 (9.10.1.2146)
     - CC2530 + EXP5438:  EW430 6.20.1  (6.20.1.931)

 - Foundation software library files for the CC2538 include the following:
     - bsp.lib, version 1.3.1
     - driverlib.lib, version 1.3.1
     - usblib.lib, version 1.0.1


Changes:
 - [5844] Modified the ZCL EZ-Mode to support the ZCL_STANDALONE compile flag.


Bug Fixes:
 - [6193] Fixed an issue where an EZ-Mode target would stop waiting for any
   Identify Query Responses when the first response was received.

 - [6129] Fixed a problem for OTA client devices where it returned the wrong
   value (0x02 for download complete) for its Image Upgrade Status attribute
   after a download completed but the Server sent the abort upgrade command.

 - [6124] Fixed a problem in EZ-Mode commissioning where binding information
   was not being saved in non-volatile memory when NV_RESTORE was enabled.

 - [6109] Fixed a problem for OTA client devices where Image Upgrade Status
   attribute had an incorrect data type - changed from 'ZCL_DATATYPE_UINT8'
   to 'ZCL_DATATYPE_ENUM8'.

 - [5918] Fixed the device ID in the simple descriptor for the following five
   sample application - they previously indicated 'Dimmable Light':
     - Door Lock
     - Door Lock Controller
     - Heating Cooling Unit
     - Temperature Sensor
     - Thermostat

 - [5839] Added rejoin back off capability to force the HA device to wait for
   a specified amount of time after attempting to rejoin before attempting to
   rejoin again, unless prompted by user intervention. The back off timer and
   scan duration can now be set at compile or run time. Default values for both
   timers is set at 15 minutes, per section 5.3.2 of the HA 1.2 spec.


Memory Sizes:
 - Actual usage of Flash and RAM memory is variable, of course, and dependent
   on the specific application. Developers should adjust various parameters,
   such as, program stack size and dynamic memory heap size to meet their
   specific needs.

 - The following tables provide comparison of Flash and RAM sizes for certain
   device configurations for the HomeAutomation SampleLight application provided
   with this release. These SampleLight projects can be found in the installed
   <InstallPath>\Projects\zstack\HomeAutomation\SampleLight folder for various
   HW platforms. In most Z-Stack sample applications, generic heap and stack
   settings are used which have been selected to accommodate a wide range of
   applications. For the HA SampleLight, heap settings were: for CC2538, all
   configurations = 6Kb; for CC2530, Coordinator/Router = 3Kb, EndDevice = 2Kb.
   See "Z-Stack Developer's Guide" for details on profiling heap memory usage.

 - Memory sizes (Flash/RAM) are shown below for the 3 ZigBee device types on
   various MCU and RF platforms with ZigBee-PRO enabled and Security enabled.
   See the "Z-Stack User's Guide" for more details on the platform of interest.

   CC2530EM on SmarfRF05EB
   =======================
   Coordinator  201.2K / 7.4K
   Router       202.2K / 7.4K
   End-Device   166.9K / 5.3K

   CC2538EM on SmarfRF06EB
   =======================
   Coordinator  106.6K / 13.7K
   Router       107.7K / 13.7K
   End-Device    86.2K / 12.3K


Known Issues:
 - The ZAP sample applications retain the older format (from the Home-1.1.1
   release), so they do not provide EZ-Mode commissioning.

 - To disable security at build time, use the "SECURE=0" compile option. Do
   not attempt to disable security by setting the SECURITY_LEVEL to zero.

 - The ZDO Complex Descriptor is not supported.
